# Sudoku Game – Data Structures and Algorithms Project (Spring 2024)

This is a group project developed as part of the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course in Spring 2024. The goal was to implement a fully functional Sudoku game application using core data structure concepts and efficient algorithms for generating, solving, and validating Sudoku puzzles.

## Project Structure
Note: Folder organization is work-in-progress and not fully cleaned up.

app/program/ – Contains most of the backend files:
- Generating_Unique_Sudokus.ipynb – notebook for generating puzzles
- Solver_experiment_unified.py – solver logic
- sudoku_full_board.py, sudoku_game_v5.py – logic for generating complete game boards
- test.py – test cases for validation

## Team
Group of 7 students from the DSA Spring 2024 cohort.

## Personal Contribution
I focused primarily on the Sudoku puzzle generation algorithm.
- Designed and optimized a Sudoku generator using a divide and conquer approach
- Created logic to convert full boards into playable puzzles
- Wrote and ran unit tests to verify generation correctness
